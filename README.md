# If your project is **React (like dynamic_image_slider using React.js)**

#Step 1 — Open your project in VS Code
* Open **VS Code**.
* Click **File → Open Folder → select your project folder** (the one containing `package.json`).

# Step 2 — Install dependencies

Open a **new terminal** in VS Code:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the required node modules (React, dependencies, etc.).

#Step 3 — Start the project

Run:
```
npm start
```
* The app will automatically open in your browser and start to run at
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# Step 4 — View & test
* Your heading (“Dynamic Image Slider”) will show on top.
* Images will automatically slide/change.
* Below each image, the **image name (caption)** will also change dynamically.

# Step 5 — (Optional) Edit your code live
* Any change you make in `name.js` or your image slider component file will update instantly in the browser — no need to refresh.
  
# If your project is a **simple HTML + CSS + JS** project
# Step 1 — Open the folder in VS Code
Make sure your project has a main file like `name.html`.

# Step 2 — Use Live Server
1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code (by Ritwick Dey).
2. After installing, open your `index.html` file.
3. Right-click → **“Open with Live Server.”**
